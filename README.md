Hello Oxygen Thieves!

I am the new guy, Peel! I basically just started coding recently and thought it would be good if I can familiarize myself in Github (hence, why I am here). I have done a couple of introductory challenges in FCC mainly on HTMl and CSS so I guess you can say that I am a full on newbie.LOL!
